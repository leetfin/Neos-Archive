This is just the consequence of linking someone&apos;s identity indelibly to their purchases. A PDF can serve as a receipt, an NFT can serve as a receipt. To me the bonuses that come with an NFT are moot because we can solve the problems it solves without indelibly linking someone with their purchases. There are already well treaded methods to do so.

This... doesn&apos;t solve the same problems. It&apos;s like you thought you should shoehorn some legitimate data privacy concerns into talks about unique digital ownership just to have SOMETHING. ANYTHING. to push back against people talking about a blockchain use case. Thankfully there&apos;s plenty of tech projects that can be blargh&apos;d at someone to sound smart but that aren&apos;t really related like GNU taler, merkletrees, json web tokens, now Solid, to try to dab on people while not really being smart enough to realize whatever the flavor is this time isn&apos;t decentralized, trustless and permissionless and why having all 3 is needed. But you might be able to fool some people and hey, that&apos;s what most of you are here to do.

NFTs are just actually bad my dude :P They bring nothing to the table to offset the frankly dystopian levels privacy erasure and classism at the cornerstone of their appeal. We can verify authenticity with any number of cryptographic hashing and signature checks, why would we use an NFT? Seriously. I have killed the sacred cow of digital ownership and a pdf receipt is just fine to me. But even if you hold that dear, what do NFTs give you that a PKI signature and ipfs do not? Why on earth would we want to involve a massive public log of our transactions when we can just verify a chain of trust on a per &apos;transaction&apos; basis?

I don&apos;t have a problem with it until it wants to be foundational to a space. I have structural concerns with it and don&apos;t see too much merit in its use to offset the changes in behavior. Experimenting with new concepts is laudable, but so is looking at the consequences.<br><br>If i challenged you to point to real public good being enabled by NFTs, I think you&apos;d agree it would be harder than if I challenged you to point to real public good being enabled by cryptocurrencies as a whole. In my research, the best argument I&apos;ve found was an initiative by walmart and IBM for tracking produce to better enable public supply chain auditing.<br><br>I find that an interesting specific usecase, pretty far removed from the core concept of digital ownership but a genuinely useful application of the technology which IMO might even justify the overhead by putting more eyeballs on our food logistics. <br><br>In the art asset space, I really don&apos;t see much positive. A lot of grifts enabled by the abstract and uncertain nature of the utility of an NFT as well as convenient conflation of an NFT and ownership whereas this certainly carries no legal weight past (best case) the initial sale. It brings to the table the promise of things it cannot deliver on: real legal ownership, the analogy of the right of first sale in a digital space. In the end it is literally only as good as the paperwork surrounding its initial purchase: it relies on that (laughable) pdf analogy to carry any legal weight.<br><br>So I say again. It&apos;s just as useful as a PDF receipt of your gumroad purchase, but with a hell of a lot more baggage and infrastructural overhead.

I don&apos;t particularly mind if someone individually sells a (theoretically carbon neutral) nft of their own creations incidentally on a storefront as an expression of their personal interest in the technology. Setting up some bridge between opensea or whatever beyond the environmental impact, doesn&apos;t affect me. At least at the hobbyist level of engagement.<br><br>I have major issues with NFTs as commercial endeavors. I have major issues enabling NFTs as part of the core technology stack of a metaverse engine. I view engaging with them at scale as inherently exploitative due to the misconceptions I&apos;ve noted about how much digital ownership is actually ownership. I cannot see a way to ethically support them at scale without a massive effort in user education and addiction support resources. <br><br>To be fair this is also roughly my opinion about lootboxes, mass produced collectables and even TCGs. I still feel NTFs have been given particular &apos;legitimacy&apos; as financial assets and a form of &apos;digital ownership&apos; which makes them even more dangerous to engage with. At least funko pops and physical TCGs actually do have the right of first sale. There is something particularly galling about seeing this level of commercial exploitation entirely absent any bastion of common-sense notions of ownership.<br><br>You can probably guess my stance on NFT TCGs :P

I have a hard time getting where you draw this arbitrary line. Because exclusion of digital items is already in most games now. Apparently being able to trade/gift/sell whatever you buy or earn in a game is what you&apos;d rather stand against. And do that by railing ideologically against what is in actuality a move toward seperating the player&apos;s data from the operating service itself and how that is more fair.<br><br>And none of this shit has anything to do with the software. Except that you&apos;ve projected all this shit onto it.

I&apos;m not sure why you can&apos;t see this as an improvement in digital TCGs. There&apos;s actual improvements easily imaginable outside of being able to trade/sell/loan/gift cards. An example from the top of my head is if you play MTG arena and you invented a new format they don&apos;t or won&apos;t support (edh for example) then you could build out an app ontop of that permissionless layer so that you could play with cards you &quot;officially&quot; have. Or more interestingly, you meet someone in Neos who plays. Now you could play manually with actually owned cards.<br><br>Sure you could say store the player&apos;s game data in a pods they have custody over it, but then its not tamperproof. So it doesn&apos;t have any meaning in a game where integrity matters. If everyone could freely edit a save in an MMO then frankly no one would play them, so trustless matters. Just like your GODDAMN example of a PDF doesn&apos;t work.<br><br>And maybe you dont like any of that shit then fine, don&apos;t play them. Or play your own version where you have all the cards and the game doesnt connect to your wallet. But obviously people care about concepts like &quot;official&quot; and ownership and having earned things, because there&apos;s free versions of cardgames but almost everyone plays the official ones. Because that ownership experience is fun for most and I don&apos;t get why you get to deny people that.<br><br>I think it gets more perverted when there&apos;s only one source for something and they&apos;re free to manipulate or twist arms with gambling, time limits, etc. which is what we&apos;re stuck with now

I don&apos;t view TCGs as desirable on the whole. They are an exploitive format, literally designed to justify card churn and keep the money rolling regardless of how that affects the playability or accessibility of play. As someone deeply invested in the traditional games&apos; scene, TCGs are a barometer for the health of a community. They will be there, and they will move an assload of product. However, the more of the store that is dedicated to them the less likely you will be to be able to pick up a friendly game.<br><br>Digital TCGs are addictive, more accessible to a degree because of the amount of rules automation they enable. I have played and enjoyed them. There is a large part of my mind that ridicules any time I buy a digital card pack though, and it makes even less sense given it&apos;s not even supporting a game store. Trading cards is the primary mechanic of a TCG. The game exists to sell more cards, it may be fun, but it is a marketing effort to sell you tat. NFTs don&apos;t remedy that, they enable it. Do they give back some of the freedoms of physical cards? No. <br><br>See, that&apos;s the rub right there. An NFT does not convey any right whatsoever to the ownership or use of the card. But people will think they do. The NFL released a collection of NFT video clips of match highlights that do not confer the right to do anything with that clip but watch it in their approved application. NFTs are useless except where they are backed by the legal license to explicitly do what you explicitly want to do. They are a technical fiction, the solution here is IP law reform.<br><br>It is just as legal to play using an asset rip from a digital card game on Neos as it would the same game using NFTs to represent card ownership. The literal only purpose that NFTs would serve in this hypothetical is a way to represent the statistical scarcity and enable the sunk cost gatekeeping that is the cornerstone of competitive TCGs, and the ruination of innovative formats. <br><br>Modeling the probabilities of a booster draft doesn&apos;t require NFTs. NFTs just enable the most questionable aspects of TCGs by churching it up in the fiction of &apos;digital ownership&apos;.

If you didn&apos;t think what I was saying was ideological bullshit it would be because we shared the same viewpoint. We are always already eating from the trashcan of ideology. <br><br>Consumerism is an ideology, just one I question heavily. Hince my purely ideological support of the creative commons, open-source software and free culture generally. <br><br>Building in mechanisms to gatekeep the metaverse, especially to economically gatekeep it, flies directly against my ethos. So I really, really do not like NFTs as they are marketed currently. I am still somewhat open to the possibility of an innovative use of NFTs that won&apos;t trip the rampant consumerism alarm, but I want to see that actually in popular practice before I will consider pushing for them.<br><br>As mentioned above, I still think they may have utility in building large scale systems of accountability and awareness. But definitively, screw designing our infrastructure concepts with the primary rationale of commercialization. Especially in a climate of pervasive advertisement surveillance. It is borderline irresponsible to push a solution that makes individuals&apos; data far more publicly exposed, doesn&apos;t have the concept of a spam filter, and is critically vulnerable to poison smart contracts.

What people don’t realize is that the Feted Inner Cabal of furry volunteers have been friends and lovers in Second Life for literally decades. The furry development scene in SL was a giant social PVP power grab game and latching onto Neos was an extension of that. These people have been at this for years including Geenz - and they socially engineered Frooxius into onboarding them as the opportunists they were. You can thumbs down this all you want. I watched all of this unfold in real-time over the past 15 years.<br><br><a href="https://i.imgur.com/G4Ecne8.png">https://i.imgur.com/G4Ecne8.png</a>

I mean, I don&apos;t see anything stopping you from building your own VR space or forming a team to build one in the way you&apos;d like it fashioned. It appears on Twitter you&apos;re dislike towards Neos, VRC, and Chillout is fairly clear at this point.

I&apos;m doing none of that, but thanks for the feedback. <br><br>May I suggest you stop attacking the personal choices of our team and instead provide feedback like you just did towards me. Their choice in fandom, self expression, identity, sexuality etc has nothing to do with this current issue and continually pointing this out just serves to label you as someone who doesn&apos;t support diversity in the workplace. Its concerning. Thank you.

You&apos;re welcome to observe their interests but your one rhetoric is &quot;neos team is bad because &lt;personal choices nothing to do with their work&gt;&quot; Its very problematic.

Tizzy has gone from that fake &quot;professionalism&quot; persona she was using here before, back when she was trying to get on Karel&apos;s good side in a very manipulative manner, and reverted to attacking people for whatever small reason she can. Got to remember the groups she used to be part of back in the SL days. Easy to revert back to old ways lmao

It&apos;s always strange to see so much stone throwing from those residing in amorphous solid silicate structures. But I&apos;m sure the tune will change yet again to peace, love and understanding the next time the fickle tides of public opinion clash with the chosen dramatis persona. <br><br>Schrödinger&apos;s troll. Yet it is no doubt a mystery why good faith is no longer assumed.... 🙄 Funny for a &apos;board member&apos; to so far distance themselves from their supposed role in organizational governance. Of course, the lack of any actual role in governance is an easy explanation there.<br><br>What a poor choice in optics, that was. Gosh, imagine if the people perceived as involved in and around the project direction had questionable histories in previous metaverse projects. Or questionable ties to the alt-right. Really, in retrospect that Patreon reward was ill-conceived regardless of how people ultimately ended up joining it.

I used koinly for my taxes. Yes it has a paid fee for the full details that need to be put in, but since my crypto tax gains and losses amounted to over $10k, which requires extra details for the ATO, I just decided to pay it and it helped a lot.

It&apos;s relevant when you have certain people constantly going to others, trying to gaslight them with things like &quot;When all 15 of the team members reject and want someone gone, doesn&apos;t that stand out to you?&quot; when in reality it&apos;s 15 close friends (and sometimes lovers) and just like how a mundane breakup can cause someone to lose a whole category of their friends, you all want us to pretend like that the same type of behavior isn&apos;t at play here.

Yeah I can see that I guess. I just find it interesting how genuinely deluded some people are. Like, how Karel can do 0 wrong to them. I wish I understood enough about it, but I saw cryptobros tearing into him for his burn announcement and criticising him for general incompetency handling the coin, and yet people here who &quot;represent the interests&quot; of NCR holders see him as a perfect angel lmao

The frustrating part about these sorts of discussions are just the like... I can agree or disagree with the suggestion of a marketing push. I can agree or disagree with NCR being sidelined. I can agree or disagree with the handling of the NCR burn, of how the strike (I am using this word, deal with my descriptivist ass) has been conducted, the impacts of announcements, the handling of onboarding, the new user experience. Like, these are valid and important conversations.<br><br>But I&apos;ve got to navigate that with people running apologetics for Karel. And I honestly believe he has done indefensible things to the point I could not in good faith argue to go forward with him. I really wish the other conversations were not so dependent on him.<br><br>Like, 100% the only reason I don&apos;t argue for keeping NCR in the client out of respect for the people who invested in the platform is because I don&apos;t think Karel can be booted without booting NCR. Otherwise, yeah. I agree, removing NCR is doing folks dirty. I may disagree with the implementation, but as Orc has said we could change implementation details. But it&apos;s a bundle of politics, and watching friends break down, and trying to weigh that visceral emotional data with a desire to be fair to the whole community.<br><br>It&apos;s hard. Harder when I see &apos;the other side&apos; (quoted for untruth) be personally insulting to people I respect and care for. Blarg. In any case, as much as I might disagree, or feel ideologically motivated/blinded, I still just want to help build better spaces for people. I hope I don&apos;t contribute too much to y&apos;all&apos;s stress with my text walls.

my take? Since there is the buyback program... just do a larger one to buy back if things did close down. Offer a long period of time on return, at a reasoanble rate, or offer to still allow imports into Neos itself with the exchange going to storage space, as we have it now. This way, people can at least get a return, and if they did buy for use internally with already functioning systems, they can do so before the plug is fully pulled.

They need something to give Karel. NCR seems their best bet. I&apos;d genuinely prefer they kept it and brought on someone to manage it as a currency. I honestly like the in game ledger with the option to offramp to a independant wallet. Would allow some limited buyer protections in game.

The problem is... there really isn&apos;t a happy medium solution to all.<br>Right now, as it stands, the current &apos;party&apos; wants NCR gone, which means a full cut off and no grace offered at all. The other &apos;party&apos; wishes to push more into something that the other party has voiced concerns over preventing new user engagement and due to dislike of the systems as a whole (and considering the current events, we&apos;re seeing a lot of that being demonstrated), thus turning the platform into something they feel is against the spirit of the platform&apos;s initial roots.

I used to just hold a neutral opinion, given I had received personal assistance when something had gone wrong and after having talked about previous ventures we had both knew about and had involvement with. However, it&apos;s become increasingly difficult to defend given the circumstances and actions taken (or lack there of). As a person to talk to, I feel they were alright, and I have no evidence to me personally where this isn&apos;t true.

They&apos;d need to bring on someone who understands and has an interest in working in that space if they went forward with NCR. I don&apos;t think any of the team are super interested in cryptocurrencies. I know they are interested in decentralized systems, but you&apos;re not wrong in that a lot of the people around them are soured to cryptocurrencies and nfts. <br><br>From your perspective, I suppose this is a tossing the baby out with the bathwater scenario. I always wanted a re-work of NCR and was never enamored with it. But it was going to enable an open market, bypassed payment processor censorship (looking at you paypal) and so I was willing to work with it.<br><br>But now it just feels like a lot of frustrating baggage and it&apos;s not even doing anything but sitting there. The most I&apos;ve done with it is give out storage to new users who already managed to blow through the initial 1gb. It&apos;s hard to even grudgingly accept it, except as a fairness hedge. <br><br>I think an honestly fair solution would be to let a crypto team take over NCR running as is and let them focus on making NCR a slick transaction experience. Transparent fiat exchange, let people engage as much or as little with independant wallets as they want. Just get the product to the point it could support one click purchases from a credit card/paypall acount or existing NCR ballence. Take all that off the team&apos;s plate while they develop the core product.

I don&apos;t know if the plugin thing is viable. The way it was initially explained to me was that they would basically be publishing a payment processor API and letting NCR be one of those options. I figured that would be viable given NCR has an established install base on the platform. But on further explanation i am of the opinion that the plugin route does too much to segment the playbase. I&apos;d still supoort third party NCR, e.g. NCR acts as the payment processor for Neos and has a contract guaranteeing that relationship with certain deliverables as riders (aforementioned fiat transparency would be a big one IMO.)

Stop pushing the third party/API narrative as if it was anything but a convenient way to shunt off all NCR users while maintaining some illusion of moral defensibility. No one buys it except the discord dick riders.

The original purpose of the ICO was to fund devlopment of Neos and increase team, resources, etc... At one point the wallet held over 64 million dollars in Ethereum... Unfortunately most of that has been used in buybacks and the wallet currently holds 40% NCR last I looked and 1 mil in USDC/Eth.

&gt;There was never proper foundational paperwork drafted including contractor agreements or intellectual property ownership. The original LTD agreement was a 50/50 split between the CEO and CTO meaning any irreconcilable feud would end in a deadlock.<br><br>&gt;Frooxius brought in a group of volunteers who were all furry friends and have known each other for years across several platforms like Second Life and IRL fur conventions.<br><br>&gt;After Meta made their announcement in October of last year, NCR benefitted from being at the intersection of blockchain and metaverse, causing it to run to $10 with a market cap close to 500 million USD. The volunteers pushed back at the crypto connection in an attempt to minimize Karel&apos;s involvement in the project even though a lot of them financially benefitted from it.<br><br>&gt;Without proper foundational paperwork, the company (And Frooxius himself) cracked under pressure and the volunteers - spear-headed by Geenz somehow thought that they could successfully stage a coup against Karel over disagreements about his management style. Some of these were legitimate (For example pay - however much they claim otherwise) and others were a clear attempt at running the non-furry out of his own company.<br><br>&gt;This didn’t work because a bunch of non-contracted volunteers trying to cancel somebody out of their own company Twitter style isn’t how the real world works.<br><br>So here we are 8-9 months later with a deadlocked platform, new users joining from VRC who aren’t remotely aware of how deeply broken this project and company is, and a bunch of burned investors.

I was one of the more outspoken supporters of Neos last year and really believed in this project, enough that Karel invited me to be on the user board of advisors which gave me a front row seat to watching all of this happen. The furries are upset that I called them out and didn&apos;t take their side, so they&apos;re pulling out all of the typical character assassination tricks to try and invalidate my opinions.

It&apos;s not my decision to make. I&apos;m perfectly happy helping or hanging out with anyone within the platform. The biggest issue that I&apos;ve seen are from those that are in it for a quick buck, those who are for pump and dump schemes. Very few people who are on the &quot;for karel&quot; side or whatever I haven&apos;t seen ever promote the platform, create on the platform, etc. I&apos;m always for other people&apos;s opinions and interacting with differing minds and ways of thinking as that generates the creativity that the platform is here for.

People came to the Telegram because it was literally impossible to have a good faith discussion in the discord. People were seriously accusing Karel of enslaving Froox; anyone remotely pro NCR was getting clown emojis on every single post for quite some time; mods locked threads and others opening threads about removing NCR; etc. <br><br>Many of us were in the discord for weeks before finally moving on to Telegram, then got chased by discord into the original Telegram channel where it became another furry echo chamber before finally ending up here.

The other thing is that most things like simple animations can be more easily carried over from one avatar to another now that I think about it. In Unity, this usually involves whipping out a text editor to manually rename the addressing bones or components. In Neos, just drag and drop.

i mean, depends on what you&apos;re doing. Unity has many points where you have to completely re-import your avatar for changes and re-do all the work step by step, usually you dont need to with bases which have unitypackages, and people maintaining them, but when you have a custom avatar its an issue

That&apos;s more or less what I do. If I have to redo any logix, it&apos;s usually because I&apos;m not happy with the previous outcome or found out something that can do the job better. Otherwise, I&apos;ve transferred logix stuff to all sorts of avatars with minimal difficulty.

Depending on how drastic the changes are you can use the rig transfer tip to automagicly transfer most stuff. There is also a Logix transfer tool, but I&apos;ve honestly never seen it work XD. But yeah, you need to build with an eye towards modularity to guarantee a generic solution.

I beg to differ. Tail wagging, for example, can just be one single object with all the components and settings stored within. At that point, it&apos;s drag and drop. Same goes for menu components and many others. But then again, creators do this same thing on SL, where they have templates for various functions and features, and just re-use it when needed. Same goes for everything else.<br>Eventually, even custom things have the same baseline humanoid skeleton, and the rules still apply.

something that&apos;s really annoyed me with NEOS documentation, for instance, is Complex Types, on the wiki you&apos;re kind of just told to experiment around, but man it took forever for me to find out that for a StaticFont, the complex type is IAssetProvider`[FrooxEngine.FontSet]

Though as a note for people trying to build their avatars in a way that will allow for easy transplanting in the future, the DynamicBlendShapeDriver component helps signifigently. You can throw it on your system and have it hook into a skinned mesh renderer to basically break the hard dependency on blend shape references as long as they are named the same.

It is an ERC-20 token. It has the same limitations as other ERC-20 tokens, you do still need to have ETH to cover the gas fees, etc, but it is definitely tradeable. There is an in game managed ledger that ballences have to be manually processed in and out of if you want to use your balance on platform for native player tipping and storage purchases, but that&apos;s about it in terms of funkiness when using NCR.

Its a trade... i do think crypto currencys are something that obviously is good and required, but it is a commodity. If you try to convert all of the crypto currency that neos has into cash right now, you would see that immediatly after 1-2% there is no more need for this product

I&apos;d argue that with how much bad press crypto has been generating for the last ~2 years, the mere association to crypto (and the &quot;metaverse&quot; term and NFTs) has actually put off a lot of people who will just outright refuse to touch anything semi-related to crypto. I&apos;ve had so many friends refuse to play Neos because at first they see the NCR and are put off by that alone.

Crypto seemed like a good call for Neos when NCR launched in like 2018 but after the blockchain/crypto boom that happened, people absolutely vilify crypto and having ties to it and the metaverse gives a bad first impression. Thing is, Neos was associating with crypto and metaverse well before they gained so much bad rep so it&apos;s not even the Neos&apos; team&apos;s fault, just their misfortune.

NCR seems cool, it&apos;s neat to have an in-game currency that&apos;s not just an in-game currency, but there&apos;s no real use for it. People will just use Gumroad or Paypal direct transfers or anything else if they want to make money making content for VR social platforms. *NCR was made to solve the problem of consumer-to-creator transactions but realistically, what person making their living off commission work is gonna put their faith into an unstable cryptocurrency that could plummet at any moment, or what consumer would want to spend a resource that could triple in value at any moment?

I have to say that is actual a valid problem. I like the idea of NCR as ingame trading resource, but at the same time its fluctuations would make it less useful then a token-system of any other kind. But it does secure that the creators of neos can&apos;t create currency from thin air... like wow-gold or any other virtual unprotected resource, and it can be traded freely

I guess the assumption is that it would find stabilityz but to also be at peace with the fact of fluctuating market prices. In its early phase now? It&apos;s very much something to speculate on or hold because you love Neos (and thats okay)

Right now, with crypto being treated as a financial investment rather than a usable currency, there&apos;s no reliability in it as a currency. If you had 10 NCR that was worth $10 today, but you knew there was the possibility for it to turn into $100 at any moment, why would you actually use the currency as a currency? It&apos;s not like other currencies where fluctuations tend to be a few cents tops. A crypto can swing high or low at any moment and that naturally pushes people to hoard, not spend.

NCRs primary function, and what it honestly served startlingly well, was to raise cspital for Neos. It fulfilled its part of thr bargain and many of us were happy to have it because we believed in Neos (and some still so) and becsuse it was an oppertunity to put money into something you also invested your imagination into. I understsnd there will always be people who dont understand or fight agsinst that perspective, just like there&apos;s people who cant get why someone would buy spaceships in Star Citizen.

I don&apos;t have a massive attachment to it being understood. If it&apos;s useful then it&apos;s useful. Though I would rather the community&apos;s investment not get deleted. I&apos;d like to see NCR usable, but at least to me that means taking it out of the spotlight.<br><br>I mentioned this before, but I&apos;d ideally like to see us operating an exchange for the (future) store. I don&apos;t think it would be a hard sell to transition NCR to a more backend technology. Minimize the casual user&apos;s risk exposure by using it as a momentary intermediary between whatever preferred currency pairs the parties have selected. That also minimizes the backlash of having a cryptocurrency price graph front and center, which I genuinely believe is liability for adoption given the current discourse in games media.

Everything we talk about is pretty much nonsense anyway, as long as the future for neos is not clear and finally decided.

The buybacks make NCR look worse. It&apos;s giving money to people who eat the new price in 2 seconds then accumulate for the next buyback. The buybacks make Karel look bad because they clearly are being subverted. They guarantee NCR has the ability to go down perpetually. It obviously annoys the anti-crypto discord users who then can easily use it as talking points to convince new users there is a problem. There were already concerns that the money Neos has was being used improperly and this just fuels that idea. What is the purpose of the buybacks?

It&apos;s still a little different than speculating on if... An emergent technology will be successful, or a business will do very well. The outcome of NCR&apos;s value depends on both the state of crypto, which is currently unstable, and also on the result of legal and internal disputes of the company that controls the token.<br><br>Since NCR may be ousted from neos in some scenarios, it&apos;s a big big gamble. It&apos;s all or nothing and that&apos;s a big risk. That&apos;s not even talking about whether or not neos succeeds past the legal dispute.

If you have a really good idea of how the legal dispute will play out because you know a lot about the law, and the court that will deal with it, then you&apos;d probably have a better idea of whether or not the risk is worth taking.

Hello everyone. I’ve been meaning to join for months, but here I am. Just introducing myself: I’m an actor based in South Africa, starring in The MetaMovie: “Alien Rescue”, a live theatre-like show in NeosVR. I am also the voice artist you can hear in the Neos world “Neos: The Universe”. Hope everyone is well.

Is this question for me? Alien Rescue  is an action/adventure theatre-movie happening in NeosVR, with live actors and paying participants. You get to shoot aliens and save some others. It can be comedic too, depending on the interactions we get from our guest players. We improv around what they give us.  Anyway, I know thus channel is about NCR, so don’t want to break any rules :)

And this is really just common sense but I feel it needs to be reminded:<br><br>Please don&apos;t argue just for the sake of arguing (this includes posting memes or snarky comments that are meant to offend someone). People tend to get defensive when they are being attacked for what they say or do and then it&apos;s hard for them to hear what you&apos;re trying to say. <br><br>If someone says something you disagree with, try responding by asking clarifying questions first, rather than jumping into a straight argument.<br><br>Please refrain from posting messages and content that is not related to Neos Metaverse or NCR. <br>Constantly bringing up drama, past situations or disputes is not appreciated so please take it elsewhere.<br><strong><br></strong>And lastly please try to alleviate the strain on any current or future admins by respecting each other&apos;s opinions. <br>If you have a question, please try to use an appropriate <a href="" onclick="return ShowHashtag(&quot;hashtag&quot;)">#hashtag</a> when you ask so we can help you more efficiently.<br><br>🙏Let&apos;s work together to make this space a bit more pleasant so everyone feels welcome.<br><br>Thank a lot and have a wonderful day!🌼

Ok, here is my first impression I had when I started with NEOS. <br>When I was on the NEOS site for the first time and saw the cryptocurrency I immediately thought of all the scams with crypto. Since I often hear only bad things about crypto in general. Except the big currencies like Bitcoin and Co, I just hope it does not continue. I have a super bad feeling about the NFT&apos;s. Since I have never heard of a good NFT.<br><br>Also, I always worry that if real money or cryptocurrencies are in the game, that the game will turn into a pay to play. <br><br>I think the patron system is very good up to the 10€ patreon, everything else above it seems a bit pointless as far as the extra perks are concerned, except for the extended storage space, which is oke, like 2d/3d badges seem pointless because you can do something like that very easily ingame about names, an exit message? I&apos;m just confused about what that&apos;s supposed to mean, I don&apos;t quite understand it, it just seems like you&apos;ve run out of ideas and you&apos;re trying to think of something afterward. In my opinion, groups should be much earlier or completely free of charge and usable for every player, but possibly without memory.<br><br>I wouldn&apos;t mind implementing some kind of storage subscription system directly into the game or the possibility of renting some kind of server for sessions as an alternative to the patron.<br>As an example: €1.99 = 2GB of memory and 2 simultaneous sessions that do not run on your own computer but on the server. How exactly that should look like I don&apos;t want to make it a topic here because it also depends on server performance and costs. that&apos;s just an example

At the moment, you can pay people with it for goods and services or buy/gift some storage. It was intended to be the basis for an in game market. To use NCR at the moment you need to be on the stand-alone (non-steam) build on neos, which is available on the website. On a technical level it tries to address some of the environmental impact concerns of cryptocurrencies by keeping most transactions on an internal ledger.

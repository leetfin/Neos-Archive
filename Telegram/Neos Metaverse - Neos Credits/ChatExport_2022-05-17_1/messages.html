If I were to go and do the same thing what I would have done is release the statement like this. Which is similar.

This is nothing that threatens the Neos platform itself however it is having a negative impact on our emotional wellbeing, we feel that the behaviour towards us from the CEO is abusive and unacceptable, and we are unhappy with the management of our employment agreements, as many of us are volunteers, new contractors coming on board has created an environment of unfairness.<br><br>There is much we have to discuss, but please be re-assured that these issues are being resolved and we are working to reach and agreement, we hope you will remain patient and forgive this little bump in our roadmap, which will continue in its deployment following negotiations, potentially with improvements towards it and a better, properly managed and organised structure.<br><br>Thank you for your understanding and your patience.&quot;

Notice I did not say anything like &quot;we don&apos;t have and never had any involvement with NCR, it&apos;s all karel&apos;s idea, we want him and NCR gone and we want to eject him from the company and graciously allow him to conduct his own business as a 3rd party we will have nothing to do with, also I have been living in his appartment for my work instead of being paid and we are having personal flatmate issues. We don&apos;t understand what he is doing with NCR concerning liquidity instead of paying us so we want nothing to do with it, here is a list of all the private documents he went and tampered with, without consulting us, here is a bunch of private corporate affairs which make Neos look bad&quot; etc.<br><br>Too much internal crap, personal issues, financially damaging statements etc.<br><br>It&apos;s a mess.

Also instead of pointing too many fingers and doing a whole bunch of he said she said look he did this look he did that, and then on karel&apos;s side, the sweet innocent act bringing more personal crap into it and further adding inflammatory remarks, with the whole &quot;I wasn&apos;t being unfair I fed you and clothed you&quot; etc. <br><br>All that needs to be accomplished is.<br><br>1. Appology<br>2. Re-assurances<br>3. Cold statement of the situation without personal issues and finger pointing attatched<br>4. intentions<br><br>So on and so forth. It&apos;s clean. It&apos;s neat. It doesn&apos;t make the company look bad and keeps the drama out of the public.<br><br>What definitely should not have been included is all the financial stuff which serves to sew the seeds of doubt. seeds of doubt are not what you want to be planting in people&apos;s minds when they are already agitated and on edge. <br><br>Stuff that makes people doubt whether Neos is going to be able to keep itself together financially, whether or not their NCR will be rendered useless, whether or not they are going to get to see the expectations that were created be fulfilled regarding NCR which by this point is kind of obligated to deliver something at least partially resembling the outlined roadmap, instead of being completely shirked while the devs openly tell everyone &quot;it&apos;s not my problem, you lost your money, big deal, that&apos;s investing also this is not an investment, karel told you in the whitepaper&quot; <br><br>It&apos;s all about damage control. You go on strike like this, you say you are having problems, there are going to be damages. It is your responsibility to the people who gave you their hard earned money... To make sure that you control the damages and minimise losses, you need to make sure that such internal business has as little of an impact on the health of the company as possible.<br><br>But instead we get the shirking of responsibility for development of NCR features, total lack of empathy for the people who sustained heavy losses because they made NCR be involved, damaging statements that need not have been said.<br><br>This was all very poorly handled.

Let me point out I&apos;m not on either side. I&apos;m being critical but I am trying to be constructive. I simply wish for business to be handled more professionally in the future. It should not take an industry expert to see that the way in which this was done was highly unprofessional. Again, it isn&apos;t the act itself. They have a right to strike.

See if they had hired a professional to arrange corporate affairs, logistics, strategy and public relations with a systematic, tactful approach, such that would meet the standards expected of a business aligned to take a major role in the growth of the VR industry and become a major player...<br><br>...They could have had them review their statements and edit them and check to make sure the devs were all happy with the statement to be released...

While they didn&apos;t violate any laws directly, the information given, the wording, and the intentions stated, are enough to get in the bad books of the SEC since, knowing the SEC, and having a professional understanding of their mentality and the way they operate, they would be all to eager to classify NCR as a security, and the SEC can basically invalidate certain disclaimers in the white paper which are not applicable to something that meets the profile they would classify as a security. <br><br>While hurting loyal investors and showing a total lack of empathy for them is bad, from a legal perspective, this was a massive blunder due to the way the SEC is going to look at this when they ultimately become involved. <br><br>Only reason I&apos;m saying this is because it&apos;s basically too late now and their only option is to backpedal on some of their stated intentions, and to create re-assurances for investors who made an investment in what is a security whether the whitepaper tries to deny liability by saying it isn&apos;t, or not.

The ultimate result in they undermine their own legal credability and give leverage to their opponent as they also escalate a legal battle they do not want to fight by this point when this could have all been resolved nicely without spilling the whole mess over twitter and discord and fuelling an angry mob on one side and a potential class action lawsuit on the other as they give investors reason to side with karel and sue the team.

Informing stakeholders is an essential part of behaving responsibly in leadership roles. It&apos;s not disputed that the situation could be handled more cleanly. I take issue with the blanket claims of unprofessionalism. This is a small company, and Froox was forced to act outside his expertise to handle the PR fallout of a founder split. Which he did.<br><br>They disclosed what the team determined to be the required information for the relevant stakeholders over what they identified as disinformation. You can disagree with their evaluation, but it is simply not the case that the behavior was unprofessional. Acting as a team for what they view as the interests of the project is pretty much what we expect.<br><br>Additionally, as you have specifically indicated personal interest in taking a job in the team and are making a multivariate criticism of your peers I assume you are not acting outside your own specific competence in offering legal opinions and related statements of competence?

It was a mess and was the wrong way to have handled it.<br><br>Personally I&apos;m just speaking off the top of my head for roughly half of what I say, the other half, I will be open about the fact that I am trying to speak tactfully on the fly, and communicate the message which has the intention of inspiring the team to make improvements, such as when I have given some of my more well-structured recommendations in regards to improvements that can be made to the UI or strategies which can be employed in marketting and creating more use-case in a very value driven way for the currency used in their marketplace, otherwise, my recommendations and constructive critique on the matter of current interest is half the picture, and covers a strategy from the business perspective, there my mentality is that of what will result in the best possible outcome and highlights what should have not been done and should not happen again and is a small taste of a complete strategy that would require days of careful drafting, review and editing, it is not legal advice, and if it were going to be used as such, would need to be reviewed by someone with a working knowledge of business law, rather than from my perspective of tactics, strategy, logistics and management.

Working with a team to conduct a proper management strategy is of course a team based game, and in practice that may play out a little differently than open discussions which are often required to reach a result, and one&apos;s own personal opinions, which contribute to the mixing pot of a strategy devised by a team when open discussions have concluded and the strategy is fine tuned from multiple perspectives utilising all of the relevant information.

Basically, I am saying it is more representative of the thought process than the final result and comes from a management strategy perspective, rather than a legal one.<br><br>My main field is actually design strategy, and marketting strategy / logistics though, when it comes to the skills that could be applied here. That differs from ordinary design in that it is oriented at designing product features in a way meant to optimise the logistical outcome in the long term, taking into acount a holistic view of the way the design is going to impact the way things will unfold both in the way the product is used, will grow, and will create profits.

Karel revealing personal information about Frooxious was a direct response to him being dog piled and accused of horrible things by the community. Every bad thing you have heard about Karel I heard get rumored around before anyone made any posts. This is up to and including accusations of holding frooxious prisonor and forcing him to code. It is impossible to explain that rumor without revealing the nature of their relationship and other such personal details. Karel had a right to defend himself publicly. In fact he was forced to.

I honestly don&apos;t understand your criticism on this front. We are not privy to the specific process that lead to the published statements, but we can at least assume each signer had input. Reaching a team consensus is usually a good (and hard) thing. The strategic landscape that decision exists in is why we seek for as wide a group of perspectives as we can to inform that decision, but like, there are 16 signatures there from pretty much all &apos;levels&apos; of the organization. I&apos;d say that&apos;s a pretty wide consulting group.

That was more self-criticism<br><br>Though as for the Neos team, honestly that&apos;s even worse because it makes the whole team look unprofessional. They should have been able to spot the flaws and been able to optimise the final draft of the statement. So they either made some bad decisions in the form of contributions or edits, or they just went along with it. Neither of which were particularly good decisions. <br><br>Also Robinhood has a point. While Karel&apos;s side could have also been handled more professionally, given the context, the result created by the Dev&apos;s statement did generally push Karel into making that statement whether it was the right decision or not.<br><br>So again.

Getting angry about Karel running a discord poll is also such a fucking red herring. It was just an excuse to get angry about crypto. Burn or stake, it really did not matter at all. Either would have been beneficial to everyone. And the majority of the people who got upset about the poll probably did not even understand what the terms meant.

If he had asked me I would have told him that it might be wise to connect staking with a system to allow content creators to advertise their goods, creating a way of advertising that can be integrated into the aesthetic of different worlds with different themes in the metaverse, which is something VR enthusiasts have been asking for, it is quite unobtrusive and makes ads fun so instead of instantly clicking away an annoying popup a user might actually choose to explore the world and see all the sites, including the well placed, aesthetic ads, which add to the overall ambience and make a world more immersive...<br><br>Pegging staking to that would allow creators to secure better adspace and gain access to more than 1 design theme, or better design themes basing staking thresholds for unlocking based on how commonly a given design theme is incorporated into a world. That gives people incentive to buy NCR and keep it locked down in staking for as long as they want their goods in the marketplace or even services in the Metaverse to be known. Which would have a very positive impact on price. Which would create even more incentive for people to buy NCR. <br><br>Instead of burning fees, which might not be suitable here since there is a hard limit cap on the amount of NCR that can be minted... Fees could be used to incentivise people to include these aesthetic advertisements in their created worlds, which goes above and beyond the inventive to include them simply for the fact that they look good and add to the ambience and immersiveness of a world.

I think this would really add to the whole Metaverse vision and enrich the potential to have a complete Metaverse Economy with real world implications, creating an entirely new Industry untethered to an economy where AI continue to eat up people&apos;s Jobs... And FIAT currency along with the system it is a part of continues to show its flaws.

Unfortunately I don&apos;t, I&apos;m more design and tokenomics focussed there, I know a bit about blockchain technology but when it comes to the actual coding...

Well that depends on where I would be needed the most. I could fill one or more positions, design, tokenomics, advertising, management, PR, corporate strategy... I know a bit of coding too but not enough for that to be a primary position, more of a supplementary one to whatever other role I might be needed in. I have spent 9 years formulating my own business plans for a tech company, and in that time I have been trying to build a complete picture of every aspect of running a business, and the work of all its departments, so that I can lead one effectively and conduct its operations and strategy wherever I can, and understand what my team is doing and why and effectively lead those teams with a strong understanding in the specifics of their work, actively participating as well as leading. <br><br>Ideas and in depth design of them, as well as strategy and tactics are where I put my primary focus though.

Not most successful, as in, most of the people who are successful, I mean THE most successful, which is a small percentage. Take Elon Musk, that is exactly what he does, building an understanding in most if not all of the various departments managing the various aspects of running a business. <br><br>Realistically, not every single area but at least most of them. <br><br>If you have Ideas, and you want to make them the best they can be, and you want to take those ideas and run with them to the very top. That is what you do. Business is competitive. There are millions of businesses most of them will only be small or medium sized ones, they will not go the kinds of places that the best of the best go. <br><br>If you want to climb up over the other businesses making products in direct competition with your target markets, you need to give yourself the advantage, because if you don&apos;t, much bigger companies with more money, more resources, more connections, bigger teams... Teams of teams even, all there trying to outhink you and outsmart you and make their product superior to yours the second you get your 2 minutes of fame by making a product that is transiently better than the industry leaders. <br><br>They will either one-up you and make instant improvements over your own design and outcompete you or they will buy you up and run you out of the industry with their vast pools of money.<br><br>That&apos;s how it works.

You think you can become an industry leader by designing a product that works better than everyone else? That is cheaper? More powerful? Can do more? <br><br>Wrong. <br><br>Industry leaders who already exist can one-up you reeeaaal fast if that is all that you do. So you have to be able to work with all of your teams effectively and understand what they are doing and why and apply your knowledge across multiple fields to design a product that is different. Not just some clone of the exact same thing with more generic features packed in at a lower cost with more power. That is a transient thing. It does not have staying power. <br><br>You need to have the knowledge to apply business strategy and make something unique and different, something new, something that hasn&apos;t been done, and you need to be ready to improve on that and apply, again, that business strategy, in order to understand how the game is going to play out, what kings to release, what aces to hide up your sleeve, and be able to make fast, strategic revisions based on a constantly evolving, adapting and growing industry that is not going to play nice with you.<br><br>Otherwise, the winner is whoever has the biggest team with the most money.

Well Neos is software and I admit programming is an area where I could and will stand to improve.<br><br>The business I studied for, but is still a long way in the making, will be a tech company.

Yes that is very true, I never denied that. However, as a designer, it is better that you have a fundamental knowledge of those fields so you know how your design is going to affect the way those fields work together, and as a leader, it means that you are able to work well with the experts that you hire, because you are going to understand what they are doing, and collaborate with them based on that understanding.

However concerned you think I am with the Industry Leader Transformation, I assure you I&apos;m more concerned with creating something meaningful, it&apos;s just a matter of how to get from A to B when the most meaningful designs are rather expensive to make. <br><br>That is why I&apos;m channelling some of my Ideas through someone else&apos;s company which I have enough of a stake in where benefitting his company with my ideas is going to benefit me. It gives me an opportunity to grow by helping someone else to grow to the best of my ability.<br><br>The most immediate design is a full body tracking system which works differently to everything else on the market or planned for the market currently, it uses newer technology that is not being utilised yet, in combination with some more traditional methods, which will unlock new ways of getting more accurate tracking data unbound from things like base stations, similarly to how slime trackers work, but with different technology which is better suited for the applications and does not have the same flaws.<br><br>This is the framework which will provide a standalone scaffolding for the boss&apos;s Idea, which is a full body haptic suit made for affordability which also utilises some newer technologies in a different way to what is currently being done.<br><br>This compliments his vision of providing the technology that will bring the Metaverse to life in a way similar to ready player one, and using the technology for solutions to real world problems, like for example as a tool in rehabilitation for people suffering from disabilities.<br><br>This is where my other idea comes in which I won&apos;t go into as much detail with yet, but it will be a headset designed explicitly for medical uses, working with current research into how VR can be used to heal people with disabilities, neurological disorders and mental illness, etc. And optimising the headset to be applied to that research.

Not everyone is going to wish to secure advertising space that way. This is different to traditional staking in that instead of sharing in the fees, the amount you have staked determines the extent to which you can advertise your marketplace goods and metaverse services.<br><br>The share in the fees does not go to the stakeholders but the people who put the promotional content, specifically designed to fit the aesthetic of various themes... Into the worlds they create.<br><br>The more you upgrade the ambience of your world with the dynamic promotional content, which by the way, can be done for free, the more you earn from collection a share in the fees.

Why would they want to? VR enthusiasts have been specifically asking for this.<br><br>You know how games and virtual environments tend to use fake ads as part of the decoration for the world?

usually we run off of formal credentials when hiring people to Do Business unless there is requisite experience outside of the formalities (typically work experience). reading some wikipedia articles doesnt really make you &quot;qualified&quot;, but im not going to deny self-study can be significant. it&apos;s when you make your self-study out to be more than what it actually is that has me questioning your legitimacy

And those are story elements.  Like, The reason you have fake ads in there is to build the fake world the game is in.  GTA uses it to show the absurd world you live in,  cyberpunk to drive home that it&apos;s a dystopia.  If you think that is somehow a bad thing and people are begging for real ads there instead then, uh, you&apos;re just wrong.

How can anyone start something and make it into something new when all that will exist will have travelled exclusively by word of mouth. So now you incorporate promotion into social circles. People talk about how great this brand is and how great that brand is and the new guy gets jack shit. Maybe they get a few people in their neighbourhood to notice, maybe it gets out to some friends and their friends. Maybe you sell 100 or so products. Now your brand is dead.

It&apos;s not the route I&apos;d go personally, but diegetic advertising is likely to have some interest to someone. There was talk about implementing such a service in the context of community messages/billboards. Not sure about the specific monetization of it, but I did always really like that 2600 magazine just let subscribers put whatever ad they wanted in the back of the quarterly. Especially in the context of a hobbyist community that sort of internal promotion of (ostensibly) fellow hobbyists is kinda cool.

Ok. So. How do people find out how good their product is?<br><br>A simple google search? There are 100s of variations of different products, sure, if you do enough research you can find what the best option is going to be, but that is dependant on the idea that people are not going to be lazy and simply go with established brands because if they are so well established surely they must be the best?

Like, a rotating joke/real ad on some Neos style billboards would be a moderately amusing patreon reward. Akin to the exit quotes, especially if it came with a good set of decorative objects for a neon future city or something XD Again, not really sure about it as a serious monetization strategy, but coupled with some actual community organization function (e.g. meet up times, official events, hints and tricks akin to digital signage in conspaces) it could be a moderately playful way to get something of an official opt in announcement system within neos.

As much as you hate ads. They are actually accessible to most people, certainly anyone with a half decent product already established in their community... And people can get a substantial amount of reach that way. <br><br>And they are necessary for people to enter into the space of bringing their dreams to the world.<br><br>Word of mouth is unreliable. You can show that with data. Try to get a large amount of reach on social media through word of mouth, maybe you have some success, maybe you don&apos;t. As soon as you get ads though, I really wish the NCR graphs looked like that because the amount of reach and engagement you get skyrockets.

You can reach anyone on the planet and if you make a difference with a good product to just one person in another country maybe you are lucky and it spreads throughout their community.

Any why is that? If the problem is that well established brands get all the advertising space and its hard to get noticed when your ad gets washed out by someone who already made it why not make the well established brands pay more and newer people pay less which would mean more advertising space for the people who need it the most?

The system itself clashes with the fundamental principles on which capitalism was built. The capitalist ideals are a lie. Capitalism is the carrot on the stick dangled in front of you that you can never catch. If you want a capitalistic system, the carrot needs to be real. People need to be able to get the carrot.

It is. The ideals of capitalism are that you can get the carrot. But it is ALMOST impossible to actually get the carrot. Capitalism should stay true to its values instead of flaunting them as a facade to make people support a system which contradicts its own principals. But if the facade were real? If there was no facade, only the real deal true to what it says on the label... The world would be a much better place where people are actually able to do something with their lives if they try.

But it is still somewhat fair if the system gives people the opportunity to first become one of those who have, so that they can gain more than those who don&apos;t have.

So there needs to be a way for people who make people work the hardest for them and what the work of those people amounts to is some piece of crap that people don&apos;t like but buy anyway... To recieve less than someone who also makes people work the hardest for them but makes a high quality product that improves society in some way and genuinely makes people&apos;s lives better...<br><br>And a way for the people who work the hardest for the person who makes the best stuff to recieve more as a result. If say, 10% of the total profits after expenses was distributed among the workers, that could be a solution. I might do that with my own company actually and practice what I preach, reward those who put in hard work and effort and subdivide those shares so that the hardest jobs recieve the biggest cut of that 10%...

Would that not be a more meaningful use for taxes that actually gives people access to the systems the government claims to spend that money on when in reality they spend most of it on stuff that does no good for ordinary citzens at all whatsoever. And goes straight back to the biggest corporations with things like government bailouts and private jets for politicians :^)

Still need to do something about those who can&apos;t work due to disability and all that but do not underestimate how substantial an improvement that would be. Some companies make dozens of billions of dollars. And they can pay up to 40% in taxes. <br><br>Apple makes $50,000,000,000 per year. Do you know how much money that is?<br><br>That means they pay $20,000,000,000 per year in taxes. 20 billion dollars. <br><br>Now imagine they pay $10,000,000,000 in taxes instead and TEN BILLION DOLLARS is split to pay the workers.

Different to socialism. Socialism is all managed by the government. You give them almost half of what you earn (here at least if you earn more than a family medical center GP)  and then you trust them to manage the system for you under the assumption that a position fundamentally attractive to those who seek power and control... Have your best interests at heart and will use that money in a way that serves you.

You never stop needing to do more self-study<br><br>But this is more the conceptualisation of political ideas that amount to a fair system where people get a fair amount of value back according to what they put in. <br><br>In the idea of a self regulating market where the authority falls into the hands of the consumer, as well as partially to competitors, then profits loosely can translate into a <em>loose</em> metric of how much society values their contribution.<br><br>It can always be abused but if consumers are given enough power, then they will not stand for being abused and a corporation will be forced to treat their customers fairly. <br><br>The framwork for that does not exist yet and needs a lot of work put into making it work in practice the way it does in theory. As the reality will likely be very different and not actually work without some adjustments.

And what do you do about inventors who produce their creations and operate large companies to mass produce those creations, but they put in the work designing, building prototypes, testing, managing, etc. <br><br>Without them the thing does not exist.<br><br>Look at Nikola Tesla, he was a great inventor, and he should have recieved more, because without him, we would not have wifi, we would still be using DC electricity, we would not have efficient hydroelectric generators, list goes on. <br><br>What if he successfully ran a megacorporation across multiple countries to share his creations.

I&apos;d argue not much of a difference to be honest. I don&apos;t believe the profit motive does much (edit: to clarify, does much &apos;To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts&apos;) , and I&apos;m generally of the opinion that individual excellence is mostly circumstance and standing on the shoulders of giants. I will keep doing what I&apos;m curious about as long as I am able. It&apos;s why I am a dorky amateur radio operator, why I put everything I can under the cc0 or MIT licence and why i genuinely hope you end up enjoying your experiments with business structure and strategies. Intrinsic motivation is how I construct meaning, and how I assume other people do as well. Not to discount the social process within that, but still.

Changing the payment system to a different one, and moving NCR to be a 3rd party solution that is karel&apos;s job and no responsibility of anyone else might as well be abandoning it.

They can do whatever they want to with Neos. They just need to impliment NCR in either the way that it was said it would be, or in a way that is even better. The rest is no business of NCR holders. The only thing that matters in regards to NCR holders is giving them what they paid for. Which was not the token. But the way in which is was to be used. As a 1st party feature.

It&apos;s the impression frooxius created when he said that it would be a 3rd party solution and all the talk was going on in the discord on using FIAT instead. <br><br>Although no one directly said that this would be the case.<br><br>I think for right now, what NCR holders are owed, is a statement saying that it is the intention of the team that NCR be used in the platform in close to or exactly the same way as they said it would be. They just intend for it to be taken care of by karel, but will not be replaced by anything different in the short term, they should state that there may be upgrades further down the track, that is between karel and the team, but that it is intended to be implimented in the way they said it will be before anything else such as potential upgrade to a PoS chain or something else.<br><br>They need to reinforce that what was told would be the case, is still going to be the case.

The statement to re-assure NCR holders is going to be a massively major step in that recovery. Along with the actual implimentation.<br><br>You can&apos;t make people hold NCR but the selling was a result of panic. Clean up the panic and you open the road to recovery. <br><br>Further recovery would be entirely dependant on discussions with Karel, the team, and those with the Ideas on how to improve the usability of NCR. <br><br>It does have a hard cap, but you can always rebase it, where you add an extra 0 on the end of the hard cap and also on the end of people&apos;s NCR balance, and revalue it at 10% of what it was, no one loses anything, they still have 100% of what they had before. Each individual NCR is worth 10% of what it was but they have 10x the NCR they did before.<br><br>One way to create a steady increase is through tying staking to something functional, like I suggested with advertising, it does not have to be advertising but offering users incentive to stake their NCR and giving people a reason to purchase NCR in order to stake it gives you that steady incline.

True, though the same incentive to keep tokens staked could be achieved by the slow accumulation method. People do not like waiting. So two things are factors here.<br><br>1. People hate waiting, the first time you stake, the waiting time should perhaps be waived. <br>1a. People hate waiting, also a good reason to perhaps avoid a long wait time before tokens can be unstaked.<br>2. People hate waiting so if you are goin to make them wait to recieve benefits if they unstake their tokens, there is a strong psychological factor there driving them away from doing that.

They can be forcibly locked or you can create psychological incentive for users to self impose locking them down. Perhaps even have a button where users can choose to lock their tokens down so they can&apos;t touch them. Doubt that will be a commonly used feature but the fact it is there means someone is gonna use it.

My initial thought would just be that it monitors the number of transactions as a percentage of coin supply, then modulates the block validation rewards depending on the activity. High rates of stationary coins would result in inflation, abnormally high rates of expenditure would result in deflation. I&apos;m mostly just curious if anyone has done something like it. It seems like at least an interesting experiment in designing adaptive systems.

There are many people who don&apos;t actually care about fluctuations. They are there for the benefits and for the long term outlook. Fact is that having the staking for benefits option there, and making users wait to recieve benefits as they slowly accumulate the next time they stake if they decide to chicken out, will have a stabilising effect. It might be less or it might be more than if staking was imposed forciblly. It could be more due to the fact that forcing users tokens to be locked down if they are staked, is going to make people not want to stake.

7 might be reasonable, but I still think that the psychological  push from not wanting to wait is both a reason to not stake if the tokens are locked, and a reason to not un-stake if they are going to have to wait for the benefits they are there for in the first place.

Yes and the reality of crypto as well as stocks and even fiat (local currency tends to swing quite a bit vs the US dollar) is that there are going to be ups and downs. What matters is that you are able to maintain higher highs and lower lows as a longer term trend at a stable rate that is not going to create a bubble. <br><br>Here within the country, nobody is concerned whether or not our currency is doing well vs the US dollar when they are buying everything locally anyway more often than not. You still pay the same amount for what you buy as you always do and sometimes you&apos;ll be paying more in USD sometimes less, but it is an internal currency, and NCR could create a similar environment and give an isolated sense to it that keeps people from paying attention to trivial short term fluctuations.

Of course it IS crypto. So it is a little bit more volatile but can also be stabilised to the extent where that is a non-issue.

For more than a year bitcoin has fluctuated to the same level the local currency does, but that is mainly due to institutional investors who do not care about short term fluctuations and are in it for the long haul or as a hedge against inflation.

...Fuck buying things from overseas you can&apos;t get here sometimes...<br><br>One of the benefits of crypto, is that it can go up, on a bumpy and eratic but sure incline. Unfortunate when that means I have 25% of the money I had but when a token keeps having higher highs and higher lows, that doesn&apos;t matter quite as much because I will have more later.

yup. That Pi still works, and that thing was tortured. It was my first one I tested all projects with: initial Linux learning, server controller (for remote management), controlling my ant miners (with a color display to boot), recompiling cgminer and another flavor miner so the terrible GPU on it could mine Doge at the speed of a snail, and then became the heart of natively compiling a metaverse server system and its libraries. It spent a majority of its life being blockchain involved to the core.

Imagine proof of green energy where instead of outdated systems intended only as a proof of concept for the potential of blockchain technology, you collected fees by putting energy, green energy I might add, IN TO the system :^) <br><br>You still need to validate the ledger somehow of course but there are ways of doing that which can work. Proof of Authority has been tried for that purpose, exactly that purpose in fact. Totally decentralised energy grid. Peer to peer, no power company required. Unfortunately, proof of authority kind of undermines the whole decentralised thing. There&apos;s probably a better way.

Morning guys, sorry if things appear a little quiet these days. Neos carries on as a beloved creator platform and thankfully people are still able to enjoy it☺️.<br>We are also blessed with many businesses and educational institutions that has made Neos part of their workflow - which is wonderful because it means more content and functionality and of course it helps to drive interest from broader user base. Which is good news for NCR as well down the line- as who stands behind you matters a lot when it comes to confidence and trust in the platform as we all know☺️<br>***And here I stress that I am talking about the faith in the platform itself - not talking about leadership and current messy situation. Creators will keep creating because Neos comes packed with features and functionalities that are in many instances much further ahead of other (and larger) platforms. <br><br>I strongly believe that Neos is too good to fail now and while we are seemingly stuck in this limbo - I have reached out to a few people lately, with plans on further platform promotion.

We are also implementing some fixes to the website which should be in place within this week - namely addressing the account verification process. <br><br>And we hear your feedback where it comes to showing more user content and in-game footage on the website. <br>I have tried to reach out to a few people who have worked on the original Neos trailer which was sadly never released, with the intention of fresh collaboration, but unfortunately not everyone is as approachable as I hoped or able to see past the current situation. Which is a shame as I believe having a nice Neos trailer on the website for instance, is nothing controversial and we would all benefit from that.

But onwards and upwards - we have an amazing support from many others and I think it is an opportunity to work on a new trailer and other content with people who truly support Neos, have a great positive attitude and understand the bigger picture - and what is at stake😊. <br><br>So I am personally looking forward to better days and of course catching up with some of you in Neos who I haven’t had a chance to talk to yet 😊

I honestly do hope at some point we can put things behind us, lay out terms that address everyone&apos;s desires, and focus on those things together and repair our divide. I don&apos;t think old wounds can heal so easily with just words, but even this situation, I atleast believe, isn&apos;t beyond both parties making amends.

Yes, I also think that people who have the interest of Neos at the forefront are those who are actually proactive already because they tend to focus on pragmatic side and what can be done.

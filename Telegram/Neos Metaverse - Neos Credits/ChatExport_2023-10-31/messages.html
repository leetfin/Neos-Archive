The safety updates are unlikely to come to the current neos client on steam. There&apos;s the webp lib and there&apos;s another one found shortly after I believe, don&apos;t remember what that one was called.<br><br>People ripped the lib from reso and slapped it into neos, it worked, the reso devs knew it would work, they also knew about half of the community they wanted were on neos they didn&apos;t go an inch out of their way to tell them that there was a security issue until several people asked about it, at a time when there was someone being malicious towards neos and reso, (altering their packet data from their client to appear as invisible and using that to delete stuff, mess with stuff with the devs unable to stop them)<br><br>Then when someone else compiled the webplib from reso to neos to distribute instead of the blob from reso, the community gave them a weird amount of shit for it. I still don&apos;t really understand why. <br><br>The person who compiled the lib said several times to the moderators and former neos devs that they should do a ping about with some fixes since the community they claim to care for is vulnerable to these issues. Myself and others said the same and kept the issue present on the discord for a while just to try to let people know.<br><br>The former devs and the mods did nothing to help. These are the people with the keys to neos on steam.<br><br>That&apos;s just one thing but remember they didn&apos;t even update the YouTube downloader exe and that&apos;s just swapping out one exe for another. No work involved. <br><br>Karel or whoever at neos isn&apos;t 100% clean there either. The downloadable installer could have been updated by swapping out the files in the installer (a little hacky but it should work). Efforts to get the information should have been done since the steam account was made but whatever. My point is the people who could have easily applied the update, or at least actually tell people about it on the discord, didn&apos;t bother and didn&apos;t appear to care.<br><br><br>However there is still a niggle that&apos;s annoying me, the money doesn&apos;t add up. The only way I see some things making sense is if the developers didn&apos;t take a paycheck in Fiat money, instead likely taking some NCR which Karel has said on the discord isn&apos;t money under tax law. Just to argue that they were not actually paid money in an attempt to claim the code from neos (now resonite) is theirs and theirs alone. (Look at prime saying he&apos;ll take a paycheck once the whole drama was settled but refusing it before) While selling their NCR for real money and even one of the devs dad&apos;s buying 10k NCR (or was it 100k?) when it was worthless and selling it when it was worth money, a dev that is now listed as a producer for reso. Hmmm a little sus to me. Not to mention a lack of legal action (no, I do not accept just talking to your own lawyer as legal action, that&apos;s just finding out where you stand legally and what your options are) <br><br>But hey, I&apos;m just a rando passing through, what do I know? <br>And to pre-empt stuff, I&apos;m not attacking anything, I actually just want what&apos;s best for neos and looking forward to seeing what happens to it (I have my own suspicion but that&apos;s too far out there to really get into)<br>And in not trying to attack anyone personally.<br>I&apos;m just looking at the situation and information and trying to make sense of it.

Fair. <br>The vulnerability was discovered and disclosed before resonite was public. I&apos;d say maybe half the beta were givin out at that stage.

That crypto though. <br>I&apos;ve used it, spent it, earned it, etc. It was always super easy to make a mistake and send it to the wrong place with no recovery or undo options. It&apos;s the nature of the beast.

Honestly, I remember in Neos people would just use paypal for commissions instead of using the built in NCR system. I think it was driven more by the fact that doing paypal was literally just a couple of clicks to send money to someone and trying to convert money to NCR and back was overly complicated.

So yeah.

Ydm pushed a patch that works with a game they&apos;d already quit deving for. I think this covers the bases plenty. The real issue here is why the current team has done nothing to highlight a fix.

Yes indeed. <br><br>I do know a bit about how steam works on the dev side. I know that the neos people have had more than enough time to get into manage the neos VR on steam.<br><br>But it does seem to be regarded as a <a href="third.party">third.party</a> client at this stage by the neos people&apos;s. Which is a bit ahhh, a little BS but whatever.<br><br>It does appear to be that both sides have left the neos files on steam to rot, with the people on the neos side keeping the servers alive.

What is the plan for the dev team to boost the player count to make a crypto based game practical? Also whats the plan for fixing the current security vulnerabilities? I feel like a roadmap should be announced regardless of size vs only answering on q/a basis. Also whats the plan to recover the pr between the playerbase and dev team?

lets assume the original devs were really in a legal bind and halted development of the engine until they were able to. When they dropped resonite finally wouldnt there be more proof of progress and distinction other then a UI swap?  looks to me like everything that was done to differentiat resonite from neos could have been done in a week or two with a good ui dev. there is no real core upgrades to show so it makes you wonder were they actually even doing anything to begin with or just doing nothing at all and blaming the other side.

see i still find it hard to believe tbh cause all of these &quot;Updates&quot; could just be then moving the system, they clearly just ported neos and had to make all new DBs and such and then dupe the olds with the migration tool and all that so all these &quot;updates&quot; could really be just &quot;updates&quot; to the currently system that isnt finished being entirely ported

no it isnt thats legal technicality. the whole thing is built on Unity to start, all he did was build a system in unity to expose the values to runtime users and turn it inside out. that system of exposing the stuff to runtime is what they refer to as &quot;Froox engine&quot; and they did all of this for the purpose of building the platform that became neos. froox engine IS neos without that there is nothing literally.

Wrong. Froox engine was developed separately. It was something he was working on preneos. And it has been used for other projects as well. See Durian.

Also wrong. Karel has said repeatedly they&apos;re not pursuing it because it&apos;s not financially viable. But I suspect it&apos;s because they know they&apos;re not in a position to win.

no hes right its not financially a good idea you know how long the case will take and how much it will cost both sides?  thats the point its such a grey area the legal case would take years and thousands of dollars and could go either way. it might be in neos best interest to just say screw it and take that money and pay a dev

if the cloud pc that house neoses db is owned by neos then taking the data to use for other reasons elsewhere is TECHNICALLY theft. reso didnt do that they were clever nstead what they did was facilitate for YOU to &quot;steal&quot; your own data. Ownership of data(sadly) doesnt work that way just cause you put it there doesnt make it yours.

Yeah that too. It could literally be bit for bit the Neos codebase except with no mention of Neos and be legal. Froox owns the code, Karel confirmed that a while ago and it’s why he wants open sourcing so bad

I’m guessing some kind of deal was struck behind closed doors, as Neos is still distributing Froox’s code on their website and through steam. I also theorize that’s why they cannot update freeimage even though the fix is right on GitHub. That modifying the codebase in any way would violate this theoretical agreement

So to preface, resonite is offtopic to here<br><br>That said, Flux is significantly more performant and better prepared compared to logix.<br>Comparing Neos&apos;s cloud to Resonites is another easy one to see where theres just a gigantic gap. as a lot of synchronization blockers that exist in one just dont exist in the other, file uploads are more efficient and mass file upload jobs will complete correctly instead of taking half a day of manual intervention to complete.<br><br>And thats only some of the ways Resonite is significantly different and better than Neos.<br><br>I understand you may not have looked into it much but i have a lot of time using both Neos and Now Resonite and while there is some issues shared and performance of course can always be improved, the claim that the changes couldve been done in a few weeks is silly

So you dont build anything on previous system? Because on neos website is this “Have you ever wanted to create your own virtual world? Neos is built to offer maximum flexibility and creative control.

We are not replacing the engine. NeosVR can still exist alongside other initiatives. The mining experience on Cooper&apos;s Planet will be available in NeosVR as well. Initially anyway. <br>We&apos;re fully aware of specific challenges of current client, such as the webp security issue, and we are looking for ways of how this could be resolved. Things would be of course easier if we had more support from the previous team. <br>But we remain optimistic about overcoming obstacles. ☺️

Tomas and the previous team have all the means of doing so. However, I&apos;m not sure how much they&apos;re actually doing. We were open to collaborating and would love to continue the development or at least some form of communication, and we have indicated this many times, but it seems like there isn&apos;t much interest or motivation on their end. I could be wrong of course.

Wait wait wait wait. I think I know what happened here. You DONT have the build pipeline at all, do you? Is that why NeosVR hasn’t been updated?

So Froox&apos; team claim Karel does still have access to do this as he has access to the publisher&apos;s account (a level above Froox&apos; account as far as Neos on Steam goes). Karel claims he can&apos;t do this as he doesn&apos;t have access to Frooxs&apos; account, which given the previous comment seems like it shouldn&apos;t be necessary. I&apos;ve personally never published anything on Steam so I can&apos;t confirm either way (or that he even has access to the publishing account in the first place).

Even if he didn&apos;t there are methods for account recovery. The issue is they&apos;re saying they require the source to do it. My estimate is they maybe legally can&apos;t modify or update it but idk I have no solid basis for that.

So, I don&apos;t think Froox would do this, but it&apos;s not really outside of the realm of possibility to make malicious code execute but only execute when loaded by one piece of program. On Windows for example you could call <code>GetWindowTextA</code> in the dll to see what the window title of the program which was loading you and then execute a different branch of code based on if it matched an unwanted application.

To make it a bit more awkward, no regulator has explicitly stated the timeframe by which vulnerabilities should be patched by. However, I think they look at it at a case by case basis and in this case, I wonder if an investigation would reveal if any attempt was made to fix it.

I don’t know if there was a right one. NCR needed the community, but the community didn’t need NCR. It was fine when it took a backseat role, but the moment NCR tried to take a more central part of the project, it was clear that they both couldn’t coexist as they wanted. And now we have a community with no coin and a coin with no community. One much worse off than the other

Save for the creators that were compensated for their community contributions via CDFT. NCR was here for a long time, and generally it wasn&apos;t minded. There was a culture clash with the people who weren&apos;t on board with far more subtle role of NCR and CDFT, but the specific cultural line wasn&apos;t NCR, that&apos;s been here for years and it didn&apos;t cause this kind of chasem, it was how the boom was handled.<br><br>Not sure we can just be like &quot;well, that community is better off&quot; when a lot of the work done is inherited from the CDFT system, and now the people who contributed just sort of have to eat the loss.<br><br>I guarantee if the situation wasn&apos;t tangled up in a power struggle the community would have been having a far more nuanced discussion on how to transition the economy without leaving those community developers holding the bag.
